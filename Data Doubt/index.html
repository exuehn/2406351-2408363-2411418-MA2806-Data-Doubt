                <p>Data Doubt is a data visualisation project for the Israel-Palestine Conflict. Within this project, four datasets acquired from various sources are presented in an interactive graph. Users could click and interact with it to access information regarding each dataset. In the broader context, Data Doubt aims to raise awareness on the reliability of information found on the internet. With the increase of news reporting sites online, distinguishing accurate and valid data could be incredibly challenging. The accuracy of such data influences public perception greatly, particularly relating to major conflicts. As users navigate through this project, they should be mindful and cautious when consuming information as certain data may be valid and trustworthy while others may contain inaccuracies.
