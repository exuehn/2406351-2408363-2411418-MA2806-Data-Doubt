            <h2>Description of Source</h2>

            <p>
                B’Tselem, The Israeli Information Centre for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories believes in creating a future in 
                which human rights, liberty and equality are guaranteed to all people, living between the Jordan River and the 
                Mediterranean Sea. The name, B’Tselem, means in the image of in Hebrew. This was decided by the late Member of 
                Knesset Yossi Sarid to express the universal and Jewish moral edict to respect and uphold the human rights of all 
                people. They document and educate the public about human rights violations in the Israeli-occupied territories, 
                including the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip.
            </p>

            <p>
                Field research, documentation, legal advocacy, and public outreach were methods to reveal and confront issues such as 
                illegal executions, deprivation of property or land, and restrictions on freedom of movement.  The organization has 
                previously faced controversy and criticism where they are were accused of being biased against Israel or for undermining 
                Israeli security. However, some argues that they play a crucial role in holding Israeli authorities accountable for their 
                actions as well as encouraging respect for human rights and international law.

            <h2>Collection of Data</h2>

            <p>
                B’Tselem collects data through various methods to document human rights violations in the Israeli-occupied territories. 
                One of these approaches include field research. B’Tselem has a team of research and fieldworkers that carry out on-site 
                investigations to gather information about related topics. They would visit affected areas to interview victims, 
                witnesses and residents. Testimonies and evidence would also be collected, which includes photographs, videos and 
                documents. Furthermore, they would collaborate with local organisations, activist, lawyers and community leaders to 
                gather materials and share resources. They also would work with international human rights associations, journalists 
                and researchers to exchange information and increase their impact.

            <h2>Reliability of Source</h2>

            <p>
                A website named, ‘Media Bias / Fact Check’, promotes awareness and misinformation of media bias. It gives a detailed 
                report on B’Tselem’s bias and credibility. The website rated B’Tselem as left-wing bias. They may use wordings that 
                aims to influence readers’ emotions, publish misleading information and excludes any information that might have a 
                negative impact on liberal causes. According to Media Bias/Fact Check, B’Tselem provides mostly factual reports with 
                a medium credibility. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Another site described B’Tselem as ‘less reliability and credibility but more politics.’ Jerusalem Center for Public 
                Affairs (JCPA) is an independent research institute producing studies and initiatives on a wide range of strategic 
                topics. The article about B’Tselem suggested that they may be unfair and trustworthy due to their dependence on fundings 
                and information from politically biased groups. The JCPA has their doubts on the legitimacy of B’Tselem’s way of 
                observation and draws attention to their influence on anti-Israel campaigns.
