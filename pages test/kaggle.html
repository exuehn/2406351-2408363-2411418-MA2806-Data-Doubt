            <h2>Description of Source</h2>

            <p>
                Kaggle is often described as an AirBnB for data scientists. The website provides a platform for enthusiasts to 
                refine their skills and tackle data science challenges in real-world setting. Kaggle started in Melbourne and later 
                moved to Silicon Valley. They received several notable investors before being acquired by Google in 2017. The platform 
                offers competitions ranging from predicting cancer occurrence to analysing how movies affect audience reaction, code 
                sharing and dataset hosting. The community is fueled with high quality content and active engagement within users, 
                making Kaggle the go-to platform for data scientists and machine learning engineers from all over the world.

            <h2>Collection of Data</h2>

            <p>
                Kaggle access and collect data through various ways to create a diverse database for its users to access and analyse. 
                The main method of data collection is by user contributions. Users are responsible for sourcing and uploading data from 
                various external sources. By approaching this collaboratively, it allows a wide range of dataset from different origin, 
                cultivating a rich and diverse collection of data available for Kaggle’s users. Users may implement data cleaning and 
                preprocessing to enhance usefulness of the datasets before sharing them. Other than this, some of the dataset offered 
                exclusively would be sourced externally. This may be from data providers and publicly available sources.
