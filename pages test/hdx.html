            <h2>Description of Source</h2>

            <p>
                Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) is an online platform for data sharing across crises and organisations. HDX is 
                managed by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and its goal is to make 
                humanitarian data easy to find and use for analysis. The website offers access to various datasets, tools and resources 
                contributed by humanitarian organisations and governments. These data cover various factors such as demographics, 
                health, nutrition, water and sanitisation, and all are free and accessible to users worldwide, encouraging transparency, 
                collaboration and transformation. At the same time, users would be able to access tools for data analysis, exploration 
                and visualisation, allowing them to gain insights and make informed decisions. HDX enables coordination and communication 
                among researchers to effectively exchange knowledge and address humanitarian challenges.

            <h2>Information Available on Source</h2>
            
            <p>
                Other than the data coverage mentioned above, HDX offers various tools and resources to assist users to explore, 
                analyse and visualise data. These are, for instance, interactive maps, data visualisation dashboard, and data analysis 
                software. The website also provides clear documentation and guides to help users effectively navigate and utilise the 
                tools and data. This includes instructions on accessing and downloading datasets, using visualisation tools, as well 
                as understanding limitations of the data. As the website serves as a collaborative platform where users can involve 
                themselves with a community of humanitarian practitioners and researchers. They would be able to share knowledge, work 
                on participate in projects, and exchange thoughts related to humanitarian data analysis.

            <h2>Data Used in this Project</h2>

            <p>
                what data did we use? why we used it? what other data was available?

            <h2>Collection of Data</h2>

            <p>
                HDX collects data by using several sources that ranges from government organisations to local communities to 
                provide a thorough view of humanitarian crises and effective assistances. Some of the data are contributions from 
                humanitarian organisations, which contributes to the information on relevant aspects of humanitarian disasters and 
                issues. In addition, HDX collaborates with academic institutions and research organisations to gather studies related 
                to humanitarian crises. These datasets would contribute to a deeper understanding of the underlying causes of disaster. 
                Another way HDX collects data is by crowd sourcing and citizen reporting. These involves gathering information directly 
                from affected communities or individuals, contributing insights into the impacts during crises.

            <h2>Reliability of Source</h2>

            <p>
                There was minimal information on the reliability of HDX on the internet. Therefore, this section would be based on a 
                review written on Spatial Reserves and focusing on the reliability of its organiser, OCHA.
            </p>

            <p>
                The review by Joseph Kerski on their website, Spatial Reserves, focuses on giving a guide to public domain special data. 
                HDX is praised for its distinctive and fascinating function that allows users to clean and visualise their data with 
                tools that work with the Humanitarian Exchange Language (HXL). These functions include the ability to give assistance 
                in tagging others’ data, spotting errors and creating data visualisation. While the review highlights the strengths of 
                HDX providing relevant and accessible data, it does not specifically discuss about the reliability of the data. However, 
                the association of reputable organisations such as OCHA may indicate a level of credibility and trustworthiness in the 
                data.
            </p>

            <p>
                On this note, the page from NGO Monitor’s website discusses the bias they perceive within OCHA in the occupied 
                Palestinian territories. It suggests that there are concerns regarding the objectivity and neutrality of the reports 
                on humanitarian crises in the region. At the same time, it believes that OCHA allegedly focus unreasonably on Israel 
                while overlooking Palestinian violations. Other than criticism on OCHA’s lack of transparency in its funding and methods, 
                the website also suggests that their actions may have a biased narrative regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
