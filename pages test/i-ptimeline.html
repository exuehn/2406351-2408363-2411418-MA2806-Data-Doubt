            <h2>Description of Source</h2>

            <p>
                The website, Israel-Palestine Timeline, provides a timeline documenting every Palestinian and Israeli killed in 
                the middle of the conflict since September 2000. This website is a project of If Americans Knew, which is a 
                nonprofit organisation committed to gather information about the U.S. connection to Israel-Palestine for Americans. 
                Their goal is to create a page with information and images for each person who has been killed. The data on this 
                website was taken from B’Tselem, which is also one of the sources used in this project, the International Media 
                Information Centre (IMEMC), as well as additional reports from news agencies such as, Ma’an News and Ha’aretz. 
                On the website, they emphasised that these data may not be reported fully due to limited access by reporting agencies.

            <h2>Information Available on Source</h2>
            
            <p>
                The timeline that this website presents is a compilation of data from several different news report sources. 
                The website includes information such as the individual’s name, date of death, as well as photograph at times. The 
                challenges and limitations of reporting on deaths in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is available on the website, 
                as well as external links that direct users to further resources for better understanding of the broader context of 
                the conflict.

            <h2>Collection of Data</h2>

            <p>
                The website collects their data from several sources. One of these sources is B’Tselem, an Israeli non-profit 
                organisation that documents human rights abuses in the occupied Palestinian territories. Another source that was 
                mainly used is International Media Information Centre. This is an independent news organisation that reports on 
                happenings in both Israel and the Palestinian territories. In addition, the website also collects information and 
                reports from the news sites, Ma’an News and Ha’aretz, about the deaths in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

            <h2>Reliability of Source</h2>

            <p>
                As there was absence of additional resources commenting on the reliability of this website, the reliability would 
                be determined by the creator of this website. The creator, If Americans Knew, is considered as a left-centre biased 
                source, according to the Media Bias/Fact Check website. This means that If Americans Knew has a slight to moderate 
                liberal bias. It has been suggested that they would often provide information with wording that may influence readers’ 
                emotions to favour liberal causes. With a factual reporting rating of high, they are said to be trustworthy in general, 
                however, may require further examination. Media Bias/Fact Check rated If American Knew as highly credible with the 
                utilisation of several different sources.
