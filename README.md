About our project:

Our project is titled 'Data Doubt'. It is an in-depth analysis and criticism of several data sources that have been involved in reporting the ongoing conflict between Palestine and Israel. Through our project we wish to spread awareness about the genocide, as well as encourage visitors to question the information they are presented rather than trusting it blindly.

Breakdown of the datasets we utilised:

- Israel-Palestine timeline - Created by 'If Americans Knew', a non-profit organisation, with the purpose of informing the U.S. public about the conflict.
- Human Data Exchange - Managed by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, with the goal of making humanitarian data easily accessible.
- Kaggle - A community created for data scientists to share their findings.
- B'Tselem - The Israeli Information Centre for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories. Established with the goal of tracking down human rights violations committed by Israel.
