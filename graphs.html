      <h2>Description of Source</h2>

      <p class="hideFirst">B’Tselem, The Israeli Information Centre for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories
        believes in creating a future in
        which human rights, liberty and equality are guaranteed to all people, living between the Jordan River and the
        Mediterranean Sea. The name, B’Tselem, means in the image of in Hebrew. This was decided by the late Member of
        Knesset Yossi Sarid to express the universal and Jewish moral edict to respect and uphold the human rights of
        all
        people. They document and educate the public about human rights violations in the Israeli-occupied territories,
        including the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip.
      </p>
      <p class="hideFirst">
        Field research, documentation, legal advocacy, and public outreach were methods to reveal and confront issues
        such as
        illegal executions, deprivation of property or land, and restrictions on freedom of movement. The organization
        has
        previously faced controversy and criticism where they are were accused of being biased against Israel or for
        undermining
        Israeli security. However, some argues that they play a crucial role in holding Israeli authorities accountable
        for their
        actions as well as encouraging respect for human rights and international law.

      <p class="hideSecond">
        The website, Israel-Palestine Timeline, provides a timeline documenting every Palestinian and Israeli killed in
        the middle of the conflict since September 2000. This website is a project of If Americans Knew, which is a
        nonprofit organisation committed to gather information about the U.S. connection to Israel-Palestine for
        Americans.
        Their goal is to create a page with information and images for each person who has been killed. The data on this
        website was taken from B’Tselem, which is also one of the sources used in this project, the International Media
        Information Centre (IMEMC), as well as additional reports from news agencies such as, Ma’an News and Ha’aretz.
        On the website, they emphasised that these data may not be reported fully due to limited access by reporting
        agencies.

      <h2>Information Availiable on Source</h2>

      <p class="hideFirst">
        B’Tselem provides documentation of human rights violations. They conduct field research to record violations
        such as
        unlawful killings, excessive use of force, violence towards settlers, house demolitions, property confiscation,
        and
        restrictions on the rights to travel. They gather these violations with testimonies from victims and witnesses,
        collecting photographic and video evidence and compile data to support their findings.
      </p>

      <p class="hideFirst">
        Reports and publications are part of the information B’Tselem provides. They publish report papers and other
        publications based on research and documentation. The information provides in-depth analysis of human rights
        issues
        occurring in the territories, specifically highlighting the cases of abuse.
      </p>

      <p class="hideFirst">
        In addition, B’Tselem engages in legal advocacy to challenge human rights violations through Israeli courts as
        well as international human rights mechanisms. They would provide legal assistance to victims seeking
        compensation,
        filing petitions and lawsuits on behalf of either individuals or communities that have been affected.
      </p>

      <p class="hideFirst">
        This chosen source also raises awareness on issues regarding human rights. This is done through public outreach
        activities, such as interviews, press releases, social media campaigns, and public events. At the same time,

      <h2>Collection of Data</h2>

      <p class="hideFirst">
        B’Tselem collects data through various methods to document human rights violations in the Israeli-occupied
        territories.
        One of these approaches include field research. B’Tselem has a team of research and fieldworkers that carry out
        on-site
        investigations to gather information about related topics. They would visit affected areas to interview victims,
        witnesses and residents. Testimonies and evidence would also be collected, which includes photographs, videos
        and
        documents. Furthermore, they would collaborate with local organisations, activist, lawyers and community leaders
        to
        gather materials and share resources. They also would work with international human rights associations,
        journalists
        and researchers to exchange information and increase their impact.
      </p>


      <p class="hideSecond">
        The website collects their data from several sources. One of these sources is B’Tselem, an Israeli non-profit
        organisation that documents human rights abuses in the occupied Palestinian territories. Another source that was
        mainly used is International Media Information Centre. This is an independent news organisation that reports on
        happenings in both Israel and the Palestinian territories. In addition, the website also collects information
        and
        reports from the news sites, Ma’an News and Ha’aretz, about the deaths in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
      </p>


      <p class="hideThird">
        Kaggle access and collect data through various ways to create a diverse database for its users to access and
        analyse.
        The main method of data collection is by user contributions. Users are responsible for sourcing and uploading
        data from
        various external sources. By approaching this collaboratively, it allows a wide range of dataset from different
        origin,
        cultivating a rich and diverse collection of data available for Kaggle’s users. Users may implement data
        cleaning and
        preprocessing to enhance usefulness of the datasets before sharing them. Other than this, some of the dataset
        offered
        exclusively would be sourced externally. This may be from data providers and publicly available sources.
      </p>


      <p class="hideFourth">
        HDX collects data by using several sources that ranges from government organisations to local communities to
        provide a thorough view of humanitarian crises and effective assistances. Some of the data are contributions
        from
        humanitarian organisations, which contributes to the information on relevant aspects of humanitarian disasters
        and
        issues. In addition, HDX collaborates with academic institutions and research organisations to gather studies
        related
        to humanitarian crises. These datasets would contribute to a deeper understanding of the underlying causes of
        disaster.
        Another way HDX collects data is by crowd sourcing and citizen reporting. These involves gathering information
        directly
        from affected communities or individuals, contributing insights into the impacts during crises.

      <h2>Reliability of Source</h2>

      <p class="hideFirst">
        A website named, ‘Media Bias / Fact Check’, promotes awareness and misinformation of media bias. It gives a
        detailed
        report on B’Tselem’s bias and credibility. The website rated B’Tselem as left-wing bias. They may use wordings
        that
        aims to influence readers’ emotions, publish misleading information and excludes any information that might have
        a
        negative impact on liberal causes. According to Media Bias/Fact Check, B’Tselem provides mostly factual reports
        with
        a medium credibility.
      </p>

      <p class="hideFirst">
        Another site described B’Tselem as ‘less reliability and credibility but more politics.’ Jerusalem Center for
        Public
        Affairs (JCPA) is an independent research institute producing studies and initiatives on a wide range of
        strategic
        topics. The article about B’Tselem suggested that they may be unfair and trustworthy due to their dependence on
        fundings
        and information from politically biased groups. The JCPA has their doubts on the legitimacy of B’Tselem’s way of
        observation and draws attention to their influence on anti-Israel campaigns.
      </p>


      <p class="hideSecond">
        As there was absence of additional resources commenting on the reliability of this website, the reliability
        would
        be determined by the creator of this website. The creator, If Americans Knew, is considered as a left-centre
        biased
        source, according to the Media Bias/Fact Check website. This means that If Americans Knew has a slight to
        moderate
        liberal bias. It has been suggested that they would often provide information with wording that may influence
        readers’
        emotions to favour liberal causes. With a factual reporting rating of high, they are said to be trustworthy in
        general,
        however, may require further examination. Media Bias/Fact Check rated If American Knew as highly credible with
        the
        utilisation of several different sources.
      </p>


      <p class="hideThird">
        Regarding the reliability of Kaggle, there are websites and forums where users discuss their experiences and
        opinions
        on the datasets and competitions. However, there are no websites that solely focus on assessing Kaggle’s
        reliability.
        Most of the time, users on Kaggle rely on community feedback, ratings and reviews from others within Kaggle to
        determine
        the quality and reliability of the datasets.
      </p>


      <p class="hideFourth">
        There was minimal information on the reliability of HDX on the internet. Therefore, this section would be based
        on a
        review written on Spatial Reserves and focusing on the reliability of its organiser, OCHA.
      </p>

      <p class="hideFourth">
        The review by Joseph Kerski on their website, Spatial Reserves, focuses on giving a guide to public domain
        special data.
        HDX is praised for its distinctive and fascinating function that allows users to clean and visualise their data
        with
        tools that work with the Humanitarian Exchange Language (HXL). These functions include the ability to give
        assistance
        in tagging others’ data, spotting errors and creating data visualisation. While the review highlights the
        strengths of
        HDX providing relevant and accessible data, it does not specifically discuss about the reliability of the data.
        However,
        the association of reputable organisations such as OCHA may indicate a level of credibility and trustworthiness
        in the
        data.
      </p>

      <p class="hideFourth">
        On this note, the page from NGO Monitor’s website discusses the bias they perceive within OCHA in the occupied
        Palestinian territories. It suggests that there are concerns regarding the objectivity and neutrality of the
        reports
        on humanitarian crises in the region. At the same time, it believes that OCHA allegedly focus unreasonably on
        Israel
        while overlooking Palestinian violations. Other than criticism on OCHA’s lack of transparency in its funding and
        methods,
        the website also suggests that their actions may have a biased narrative regarding the Israeli-Palestinian
        conflict.
